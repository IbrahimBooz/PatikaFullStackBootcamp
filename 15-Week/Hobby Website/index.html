        <h3>Basic Premise</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Dota 2 is an RTS-styled MOBA-type competitive team game with RPG elements. Two competing teams (Radiant and
            Dire) consist of five players each. The main objective in Dota 2 is to destroy the enemy Ancient inside
            their stronghold. These strongholds are protected by multiple towers down 3 lanes. Instead of building
            armies of units like in classical RTS games, each player controls a single Hero, a strategically-powerful
            unit with unique abilities and characteristics which can be improved over the course of the game. Experience
            is earned when nearby creeps and heroes die, and once collecting enough experience, the hero gains a level,
            which increases the hero's stats, and at most levels the hero gains a skill point which can be spent to
            unlock or upgrade one of the hero's abilities. Alongside a hero's fixed abilities, each hero has 6 inventory
            slots which can be filled with Items which provide various benefits and abilities. To purchase these items,
            Gold is gained passively over time, by killing creeps, by killing enemy heroes and by destroying buildings.
        </p>
        <h3>Development</h3>
        <p>IceFrog, the lead developer for the original Defense of the Ancients, was hired by Valve Software in 2009.
            The beta began in 2010, officially ending in July 2013 just before The International 2013 when the Windows
            client was officially released to the public with a queue system to deal with high traffic. The Mac and
            Linux clients were released a week after the general release of the Windows client. Dota 2 runs on the
            Source 2 Engine and mimics some of the quirks that were present in the original DotA game in order to
            preserve gameplay.</p>
        <h3>Heroes</h3>
        <p>Heroes are each unique characters within Dota 2. At the start of each game, two teams of five are randomly
            assigned to Radiant and Dire, then sides take turns selecting a Hero from the Hero Pool. Each player
            controls a single Hero and any units that hero controls, such as summoned units like Eidolons. The selection
            of these 10 heroes is commonly referred to as that match's draft.
            Heroes will gain experience when enemy units are killed nearby. They start the game at level one, and as
            they earn experience, they eventually level up, and each level grants more increases to the hero's
            attributes and an ability point to spend on upgrading abilities or Talents.
            In addition to a hero's abilities, each hero has a melee or ranged attack which does an amount of damage
            based on the primary attribute: strength, agility, or intelligence.
            Dota 2 has currently implemented 124 heroes. 112 of these heroes were based on heroes from DotA Allstars;
            and after porting all the DotA heroes, 12 more original heroes have been added.</p>
